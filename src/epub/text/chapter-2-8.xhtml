			<p>“I <em>did</em> not expect you, gentlemen,” began the prince. “I have been ill until today. A month ago,” he continued, addressing himself to Antip Burdovsky, “I put your business into Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin’s hands, as I told you then. I do not in the least object to having a personal interview⁠ ⁠… but you will agree with me that this is hardly the time⁠ ⁠… I propose that we go into another room, if you will not keep me long⁠ ⁠… As you see, I have friends here, and believe me⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Friends as many as you please, but allow me,” interrupted the harsh voice of Lebedeff’s nephew⁠—“allow me to tell you that you might have treated us rather more politely, and not have kept us waiting at least two hours⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“No doubt⁠ ⁠… and I⁠ ⁠… is that acting like a prince? And you⁠ ⁠… you may be a general! But I⁠ ⁠… I am not your valet! And I⁠ ⁠… I⁠ ⁠…” stammered Antip Burdovsky.</p>
			<p>He was extremely excited; his lips trembled, and the resentment of an embittered soul was in his voice. But he spoke so indistinctly that hardly a dozen words could be gathered.</p>
			<p>“It was a princely action!” sneered Hippolyte.</p>
			<p>“If anyone had treated me so,” grumbled the boxer.</p>
			<p>“I mean to say that if I had been in Burdovsky’s place⁠ ⁠… I⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Gentlemen, I did not know you were there; I have only just been informed, I assure you,” repeated Muishkin.</p>
			<p>“We are not afraid of your friends, prince,” remarked Lebedeff’s nephew, “for we are within our rights.”</p>
			<p>The shrill tones of Hippolyte interrupted him. “What right have you⁠ ⁠… by what right do you demand us to submit this matter, about Burdovsky⁠ ⁠… to the judgment of your friends? We know only too well what the judgment of your friends will be!⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>This beginning gave promise of a stormy discussion. The prince was much discouraged, but at last he managed to make himself heard amid the vociferations of his excited visitors.</p>
			<p>“If you,” he said, addressing Burdovsky⁠—“if you prefer not to speak here, I offer again to go into another room with you⁠ ⁠… and as to your waiting to see me, I repeat that I only this instant heard⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Well, you have no right, you have no right, no right at all!⁠ ⁠… Your friends indeed!”⁠ ⁠… gabbled Burdovsky, defiantly examining the faces round him, and becoming more and more excited. “You have no right!⁠ ⁠…” As he ended thus abruptly, he leant forward, staring at the prince with his shortsighted, bloodshot eyes. The latter was so astonished, that he did not reply, but looked steadily at him in return.</p>
			<p>“Lef Nicolaievitch!” interposed Madame Epanchin, suddenly, “read this at once, this very moment! It is about this business.”</p>
			<p>She held out a weekly comic paper, pointing to an article on one of its pages. Just as the visitors were coming in, Lebedeff, wishing to ingratiate himself with the great lady, had pulled this paper from his pocket, and presented it to her, indicating a few columns marked in pencil. Lizabetha Prokofievna had had time to read some of it, and was greatly upset.</p>
			<p>“Would it not be better to peruse it alone⁠ ⁠… later,” asked the prince, nervously.</p>
			<p>“No, no, read it⁠—read it at once directly, and aloud, aloud!” cried she, calling Colia to her and giving him the journal.⁠—“Read it aloud, so that everyone may hear it!”</p>
			<p>An impetuous woman, Lizabetha Prokofievna sometimes weighed her anchors and put out to sea quite regardless of the possible storms she might encounter. Ivan Fedorovitch felt a sudden pang of alarm, but the others were merely curious, and somewhat surprised. Colia unfolded the paper, and began to read, in his clear, high-pitched voice, the following article:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“Proletarians and scions of nobility! An episode of the brigandage of today and every day! Progress! Reform! Justice!</p>
				<p>“Strange things are going on in our so-called Holy Russia in this age of reform and great enterprises; this age of patriotism in which hundreds of millions are yearly sent abroad; in which industry is encouraged, and the hands of Labour paralyzed, <abbr>etc.</abbr>; there is no end to this, gentlemen, so let us come to the point. A strange thing has happened to a scion of our defunct aristocracy. (<i xml:lang="la">De profundis!</i>) The grandfathers of these scions ruined themselves at the gaming-tables; their fathers were forced to serve as officers or subalterns; some have died just as they were about to be tried for innocent thoughtlessness in the handling of public funds. Their children are sometimes congenital idiots, like the hero of our story; sometimes they are found in the dock at the Assizes, where they are generally acquitted by the jury for edifying motives; sometimes they distinguish themselves by one of those burning scandals that amaze the public and add another blot to the stained record of our age. Six months ago⁠—that is, last winter⁠—this particular scion returned to Russia, wearing gaiters like a foreigner, and shivering with cold in an old scantily-lined cloak. He had come from Switzerland, where he had just undergone a successful course of treatment for idiocy (sic!). Certainly Fortune favoured him, for, apart from the interesting malady of which he was cured in Switzerland (can there be a cure for idiocy?) his story proves the truth of the Russian proverb that ‘happiness is the right of certain classes!’ Judge for yourselves. Our subject was an infant in arms when he lost his father, an officer who died just as he was about to be court-martialled for gambling away the funds of his company, and perhaps also for flogging a subordinate to excess (remember the good old days, gentlemen). The orphan was brought up by the charity of a very rich Russian landowner. In the good old days, this man, whom we will call P⁠⸺, owned 4,000 souls as serfs (souls as serfs!⁠—can you understand such an expression, gentlemen? I cannot; it must be looked up in a dictionary before one can understand it; these things of a bygone day are already unintelligible to us). He appears to have been one of those Russian parasites who lead an idle existence abroad, spending the summer at some spa, and the winter in Paris, to the greater profit of the organizers of public balls. It may safely be said that the manager of the Château des Fleurs (lucky man!) pocketed at least a third of the money paid by Russian peasants to their lords in the days of serfdom. However this may be, the gay P⁠⸺ brought up the orphan like a prince, provided him with tutors and governesses (pretty, of course!) whom he chose himself in Paris. But the little aristocrat, the last of his noble race, was an idiot. The governesses, recruited at the Château des Fleurs, laboured in vain; at twenty years of age their pupil could not speak in any language, not even Russian. But ignorance of the latter was still excusable. At last P⁠⸺ was seized with a strange notion; he imagined that in Switzerland they could change an idiot into a man of sense. After all, the idea was quite logical; a parasite and landowner naturally supposed that intelligence was a marketable commodity like everything else, and that in Switzerland especially it could be bought for money. The case was entrusted to a celebrated Swiss professor, and cost thousands of roubles; the treatment lasted five years. Needless to say, the idiot did not become intelligent, but it is alleged that he grew into something more or less resembling a man. At this stage P⁠⸺ died suddenly, and, as usual, he had made no will and left his affairs in disorder. A crowd of eager claimants arose, who cared nothing about any last scion of a noble race undergoing treatment in Switzerland, at the expense of the deceased, as a congenital idiot. Idiot though he was, the noble scion tried to cheat his professor, and they say he succeeded in getting him to continue the treatment gratis for two years, by concealing the death of his benefactor. But the professor himself was a charlatan. Getting anxious at last when no money was forthcoming, and alarmed above all by his patient’s appetite, he presented him with a pair of old gaiters and a shabby cloak and packed him off to Russia, third class. It would seem that Fortune had turned her back upon our hero. Not at all; Fortune, who lets whole populations die of hunger, showered all her gifts at once upon the little aristocrat, like Kryloff’s ‘<span epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Cloud</span>’ which passes over an arid plain and empties itself into the sea. He had scarcely arrived in <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg, when a relation of his mother’s (who was of bourgeois origin, of course), died at Moscow. He was a merchant, an Old Believer, and he had no children. He left a fortune of several millions in good current coin, and everything came to our noble scion, our gaitered baron, formerly treated for idiocy in a Swiss lunatic asylum. Instantly the scene changed, crowds of friends gathered round our baron, who meanwhile had lost his head over a celebrated demimondaine; he even discovered some relations; moreover a number of young girls of high birth burned to be united to him in lawful matrimony. Could anyone possibly imagine a better match? Aristocrat, millionaire, and idiot, he has every advantage! One might hunt in vain for his equal, even with the lantern of Diogenes; his like is not to be had even by getting it made to order!”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“Oh, I don’t know what this means!” cried Ivan Fedorovitch, transported with indignation.</p>
			<p>“Leave off, Colia,” begged the prince. Exclamations arose on all sides.</p>
			<p>“Let him go on reading at all costs!” ordered Lizabetha Prokofievna, evidently preserving her composure by a desperate effort. “Prince, if the reading is stopped, you and I will quarrel.”</p>
			<p>Colia had no choice but to obey. With crimson cheeks he read on unsteadily:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“But while our young millionaire dwelt as it were in the Empyrean, something new occurred. One fine morning a man called upon him, calm and severe of aspect, distinguished, but plainly dressed. Politely, but in dignified terms, as befitted his errand, he briefly explained the motive for his visit. He was a lawyer of enlightened views; his client was a young man who had consulted him in confidence. This young man was no other than the son of P⁠⸺, though he bears another name. In his youth P⁠⸺, the sensualist, had seduced a young girl, poor but respectable. She was a serf, but had received a European education. Finding that a child was expected, he hastened her marriage with a man of noble character who had loved her for a long time. He helped the young couple for a time, but he was soon obliged to give up, for the high-minded husband refused to accept anything from him. Soon the careless nobleman forgot all about his former mistress and the child she had borne him; then, as we know, he died intestate. P⁠⸺’s son, born after his mother’s marriage, found a true father in the generous man whose name he bore. But when he also died, the orphan was left to provide for himself, his mother now being an invalid who had lost the use of her limbs. Leaving her in a distant province, he came to the capital in search of pupils. By dint of daily toil he earned enough to enable him to follow the college courses, and at last to enter the university. But what can one earn by teaching the children of Russian merchants at ten copecks a lesson, especially with an invalid mother to keep? Even her death did not much diminish the hardships of the young man’s struggle for existence. Now this is the question: how, in the name of justice, should our scion have argued the case? Our readers will think, no doubt, that he would say to himself: ‘P⁠⸺ showered benefits upon me all my life; he spent tens of thousands of roubles to educate me, to provide me with governesses, and to keep me under treatment in Switzerland. Now I am a millionaire, and P⁠⸺’s son, a noble young man who is not responsible for the faults of his careless and forgetful father, is wearing himself out giving ill-paid lessons. According to justice, all that was done for me ought to have been done for him. The enormous sums spent upon me were not really mine; they came to me by an error of blind Fortune, when they ought to have gone to P⁠⸺’s son. They should have gone to benefit him, not me, in whom P⁠⸺ interested himself by a mere caprice, instead of doing his duty as a father. If I wished to behave nobly, justly, and with delicacy, I ought to bestow half my fortune upon the son of my benefactor; but as economy is my favourite virtue, and I know this is not a case in which the law can intervene, I will not give up half my millions. But it would be too openly vile, too flagrantly infamous, if I did not at least restore to P⁠⸺’s son the tens of thousands of roubles spent in curing my idiocy. This is simply a case of conscience and of strict justice. Whatever would have become of me if P⁠⸺ had not looked after my education, and had taken care of his own son instead of me?’</p>
				<p>“No, gentlemen, our scions of the nobility do not reason thus. The lawyer, who had taken up the matter purely out of friendship to the young man, and almost against his will, invoked every consideration of justice, delicacy, honour, and even plain figures; in vain, the ex-patient of the Swiss lunatic asylum was inflexible. All this might pass, but the sequel is absolutely unpardonable, and not to be excused by any interesting malady. This millionaire, having but just discarded the old gaiters of his professor, could not even understand that the noble young man slaving away at his lessons was not asking for charitable help, but for his rightful due, though the debt was not a legal one; that, correctly speaking, he was not asking for anything, but it was merely his friends who had thought fit to bestir themselves on his behalf. With the cool insolence of a bloated capitalist, secure in his millions, he majestically drew a banknote for fifty roubles from his pocketbook and sent it to the noble young man as a humiliating piece of charity. You can hardly believe it, gentlemen! You are scandalized and disgusted; you cry out in indignation! But that is what he did! Needless to say, the money was returned, or rather flung back in his face. The case is not within the province of the law, it must be referred to the tribunal of public opinion; this is what we now do, guaranteeing the truth of all the details which we have related.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>When Colia had finished reading, he handed the paper to the prince, and retired silently to a corner of the room, hiding his face in his hands. He was overcome by a feeling of inexpressible shame; his boyish sensitiveness was wounded beyond endurance. It seemed to him that something extraordinary, some sudden catastrophe had occurred, and that he was almost the cause of it, because he had read the article aloud.</p>
			<p>Yet all the others were similarly affected. The girls were uncomfortable and ashamed. Lizabetha Prokofievna restrained her violent anger by a great effort; perhaps she bitterly regretted her interference in the matter; for the present she kept silence. The prince felt as very shy people often do in such a case; he was so ashamed of the conduct of other people, so humiliated for his guests, that he dared not look them in the face. Ptitsin, Varia, Gania, and Lebedeff himself, all looked rather confused. Stranger still, Hippolyte and the “son of Pavlicheff” also seemed slightly surprised, and Lebedeff’s nephew was obviously far from pleased. The boxer alone was perfectly calm; he twisted his moustaches with affected dignity, and if his eyes were cast down it was certainly not in confusion, but rather in noble modesty, as if he did not wish to be insolent in his triumph. It was evident that he was delighted with the article.</p>
			<p>“The devil knows what it means,” growled Ivan Fedorovitch, under his breath; “it must have taken the united wits of fifty footmen to write it.”</p>
			<p>“May I ask your reason for such an insulting supposition, sir?” said Hippolyte, trembling with rage.</p>
			<p>“You will admit yourself, general, that for an honourable man, if the author is an honourable man, that is an⁠—an insult,” growled the boxer suddenly, with convulsive jerkings of his shoulders.</p>
			<p>“In the first place, it is not for you to address me as ‘sir,’ and, in the second place, I refuse to give you any explanation,” said Ivan Fedorovitch vehemently; and he rose without another word, and went and stood on the first step of the flight that led from the verandah to the street, turning his back on the company. He was indignant with Lizabetha Prokofievna, who did not think of moving even now.</p>
			<p>“Gentlemen, gentlemen, let me speak at last,” cried the prince, anxious and agitated. “Please let us understand one another. I say nothing about the article, gentlemen, except that every word is false; I say this because you know it as well as I do. It is shameful. I should be surprised if any one of you could have written it.”</p>
			<p>“I did not know of its existence till this moment,” declared Hippolyte. “I do not approve of it.”</p>
			<p>“I knew it had been written, but I would not have advised its publication,” said Lebedeff’s nephew, “because it is premature.”</p>
			<p>“I knew it, but I have a right. I⁠ ⁠… I⁠ ⁠…” stammered the “son of Pavlicheff.”</p>
			<p>“What! Did you write all that yourself? Is it possible?” asked the prince, regarding Burdovsky with curiosity.</p>
			<p>“One might dispute your right to ask such questions,” observed Lebedeff’s nephew.</p>
			<p>“I was only surprised that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky should have⁠—however, this is what I have to say. Since you had already given the matter publicity, why did you object just now, when I began to speak of it to my friends?”</p>
			<p>“At last!” murmured Lizabetha Prokofievna indignantly.</p>
			<p>Lebedeff could restrain himself no longer; he made his way through the row of chairs.</p>
			<p>“Prince,” he cried, “you are forgetting that if you consented to receive and hear them, it was only because of your kind heart which has no equal, for they had not the least right to demand it, especially as you had placed the matter in the hands of Gavrila Ardalionovitch, which was also extremely kind of you. You are also forgetting, most excellent prince, that you are with friends, a select company; you cannot sacrifice them to these gentlemen, and it is only for you to have them turned out this instant. As the master of the house I shall have great pleasure.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Quite right!” agreed General Ivolgin in a loud voice.</p>
			<p>“That will do, Lebedeff, that will do⁠—” began the prince, when an indignant outcry drowned his words.</p>
			<p>“Excuse me, prince, excuse me, but now that will not do,” shouted Lebedeff’s nephew, his voice dominating all the others. “The matter must be clearly stated, for it is obviously not properly understood. They are calling in some legal chicanery, and upon that ground they are threatening to turn us out of the house! Really, prince, do you think we are such fools as not to be aware that this matter does not come within the law, and that legally we cannot claim a rouble from you? But we are also aware that if actual law is not on our side, human law is for us, natural law, the law of common sense and conscience, which is no less binding upon every noble and honest man⁠—that is, every man of sane judgment⁠—because it is not to be found in miserable legal codes. If we come here without fear of being turned out (as was threatened just now) because of the imperative tone of our demand, and the unseemliness of such a visit at this late hour (though it was not late when we arrived, we were kept waiting in your anteroom), if, I say, we came in without fear, it is just because we expected to find you a man of sense; I mean, a man of honour and conscience. It is quite true that we did not present ourselves humbly, like your flatterers and parasites, but holding up our heads as befits independent men. We present no petition, but a proud and free demand (note it well, we do not beseech, we demand!). We ask you fairly and squarely in a dignified manner. Do you believe that in this affair of Burdovsky you have right on your side? Do you admit that Pavlicheff overwhelmed you with benefits, and perhaps saved your life? If you admit it (which we take for granted), do you intend, now that you are a millionaire, and do you not think it in conformity with justice, to indemnify Burdovsky? Yes or no? If it is <em>yes</em>, or, in other words, if you possess what you call honour and conscience, and we more justly call common sense, then accede to our demand, and the matter is at an end. Give us satisfaction, without entreaties or thanks from us; do not expect thanks from us, for what you do will be done not for our sake, but for the sake of justice. If you refuse to satisfy us, that is, if your answer is <em>no</em>, we will go away at once, and there will be an end of the matter. But we will tell you to your face before the present company that you are a man of vulgar and undeveloped mind; we will openly deny you the right to speak in future of your honour and conscience, for you have not paid the fair price of such a right. I have no more to say⁠—I have put the question before you. Now turn us out if you dare. You can do it; force is on your side. But remember that we do not beseech, we demand! We do not beseech, we demand!”</p>
			<p>With these last excited words, Lebedeff’s nephew was silent.</p>
			<p>“We demand, we demand, we demand, we do not beseech,” spluttered Burdovsky, red as a lobster.</p>
			<p>The speech of Lebedeff’s nephew caused a certain stir among the company; murmurs arose, though with the exception of Lebedeff, who was still very much excited, everyone was careful not to interfere in the matter. Strangely enough, Lebedeff, although on the prince’s side, seemed quite proud of his nephew’s eloquence. Gratified vanity was visible in the glances he cast upon the assembled company.</p>
			<p>“In my opinion, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Doktorenko,” said the prince, in rather a low voice, “you are quite right in at least half of what you say. I would go further and say that you are altogether right, and that I quite agree with you, if there were not something lacking in your speech. I cannot undertake to say precisely what it is, but you have certainly omitted something, and you cannot be quite just while there is something lacking. But let us put that aside and return to the point. Tell me what induced you to publish this article. Every word of it is a calumny, and I think, gentlemen, that you have been guilty of a mean action.”</p>
			<p>“Allow me⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Sir⁠—”</p>
			<p>“What? What? What?” cried all the visitors at once, in violent agitation.</p>
			<p>“As to the article,” said Hippolyte in his croaking voice, “I have told you already that we none of us approve of it! There is the writer,” he added, pointing to the boxer, who sat beside him. “I quite admit that he has written it in his old regimental manner, with an equal disregard for style and decency. I know he is a cross between a fool and an adventurer; I make no bones about telling him so to his face every day. But after all he is half justified; publicity is the lawful right of every man; consequently, Burdovsky is not excepted. Let him answer for his own blunders. As to the objection which I made just now in the name of all, to the presence of your friends, I think I ought to explain, gentlemen, that I only did so to assert our rights, though we really wished to have witnesses; we had agreed unanimously upon the point before we came in. We do not care who your witnesses may be, or whether they are your friends or not. As they cannot fail to recognize Burdovsky’s right (seeing that it is mathematically demonstrable), it is just as well that the witnesses should be your friends. The truth will only be more plainly evident.”</p>
			<p>“It is quite true; we had agreed upon that point,” said Lebedeff’s nephew, in confirmation.</p>
			<p>“If that is the case, why did you begin by making such a fuss about it?” asked the astonished prince.</p>
			<p>The boxer was dying to get in a few words; owing, no doubt, to the presence of the ladies, he was becoming quite jovial.</p>
			<p>“As to the article, prince,” he said, “I admit that I wrote it, in spite of the severe criticism of my poor friend, in whom I always overlook many things because of his unfortunate state of health. But I wrote and published it in the form of a letter, in the paper of a friend. I showed it to no one but Burdovsky, and I did not read it all through, even to him. He immediately gave me permission to publish it, but you will admit that I might have done so without his consent. Publicity is a noble, beneficent, and universal right. I hope, prince, that you are too progressive to deny this?”</p>
			<p>“I deny nothing, but you must confess that your article⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Is a bit thick, you mean? Well, in a way that is in the public interest; you will admit that yourself, and after all one cannot overlook a blatant fact. So much the worse for the guilty parties, but the public welfare must come before everything. As to certain inaccuracies and figures of speech, so to speak, you will also admit that the motive, aim, and intention, are the chief thing. It is a question, above all, of making a wholesome example; the individual case can be examined afterwards; and as to the style⁠—well, the thing was meant to be humorous, so to speak, and, after all, everybody writes like that; you must admit it yourself! Ha, ha!”</p>
			<p>“But, gentlemen, I assure you that you are quite astray,” exclaimed the prince. “You have published this article upon the supposition that I would never consent to satisfy <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky. Acting on that conviction, you have tried to intimidate me by this publication and to be revenged for my supposed refusal. But what did you know of my intentions? It may be that I have resolved to satisfy <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky’s claim. I now declare openly, in the presence of these witnesses, that I will do so.”</p>
			<p>“The noble and intelligent word of an intelligent and most noble man, at last!” exclaimed the boxer.</p>
			<p>“Good God!” exclaimed Lizabetha Prokofievna involuntarily.</p>
			<p>“This is intolerable,” growled the general.</p>
			<p>“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me,” urged the prince. “I will explain matters to you. Five weeks ago I received a visit from Tchebaroff, your agent, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky. You have given a very flattering description of him in your article, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Keller,” he continued, turning to the boxer with a smile, “but he did not please me at all. I saw at once that Tchebaroff was the moving spirit in the matter, and, to speak frankly, I thought he might have induced you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky, to make this claim, by taking advantage of your simplicity.”</p>
			<p>“You have no right.⁠ ⁠… I am not simple,” stammered Burdovsky, much agitated.</p>
			<p>“You have no sort of right to suppose such things,” said Lebedeff’s nephew in a tone of authority.</p>
			<p>“It is most offensive!” shrieked Hippolyte; “it is an insulting suggestion, false, and most ill-timed.”</p>
			<p>“I beg your pardon, gentlemen; please excuse me,” said the prince. “I thought absolute frankness on both sides would be best, but have it your own way. I told Tchebaroff that, as I was not in Petersburg, I would commission a friend to look into the matter without delay, and that I would let you know, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky. Gentlemen, I have no hesitation in telling you that it was the fact of Tchebaroff’s intervention that made me suspect a fraud. Oh! do not take offence at my words, gentlemen, for Heaven’s sake do not be so touchy!” cried the prince, seeing that Burdovsky was getting excited again, and that the rest were preparing to protest. “If I say I suspected a fraud, there is nothing personal in that. I had never seen any of you then; I did not even know your names; I only judged by Tchebaroff; I am speaking quite generally⁠—if you only knew how I have been ‘done’ since I came into my fortune!”</p>
			<p>“You are shockingly naive, prince,” said Lebedeff’s nephew in mocking tones.</p>
			<p>“Besides, though you are a prince and a millionaire, and even though you may really be simple and good-hearted, you can hardly be outside the general law,” Hippolyte declared loudly.</p>
			<p>“Perhaps not; it is very possible,” the prince agreed hastily, “though I do not know what general law you allude to. I will go on⁠—only please do not take offence without good cause. I assure you I do not mean to offend you in the least. Really, it is impossible to speak three words sincerely without your flying into a rage! At first I was amazed when Tchebaroff told me that Pavlicheff had a son, and that he was in such a miserable position. Pavlicheff was my benefactor, and my father’s friend. Oh, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Keller, why does your article impute things to my father without the slightest foundation? He never squandered the funds of his company nor ill-treated his subordinates, I am absolutely certain of it; I cannot imagine how you could bring yourself to write such a calumny! But your assertions concerning Pavlicheff are absolutely intolerable! You do not scruple to make a libertine of that noble man; you call him a sensualist as coolly as if you were speaking the truth, and yet it would not be possible to find a chaster man. He was even a scholar of note, and in correspondence with several celebrated scientists, and spent large sums in the interests of science. As to his kind heart and his good actions, you were right indeed when you said that I was almost an idiot at that time, and could hardly understand anything⁠—(I could speak and understand Russian, though)⁠—but now I can appreciate what I remember⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Excuse me,” interrupted Hippolyte, “is not this rather sentimental? You said you wished to come to the point; please remember that it is after nine o’clock.”</p>
			<p>“Very well, gentlemen⁠—very well,” replied the prince. “At first I received the news with mistrust, then I said to myself that I might be mistaken, and that Pavlicheff might possibly have had a son. But I was absolutely amazed at the readiness with which the son had revealed the secret of his birth at the expense of his mother’s honour. For Tchebaroff had already menaced me with publicity in our interview.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“What nonsense!” Lebedeff’s nephew interrupted violently.</p>
			<p>“You have no right⁠—you have no right!” cried Burdovsky.</p>
			<p>“The son is not responsible for the misdeeds of his father; and the mother is not to blame,” added Hippolyte, with warmth.</p>
			<p>“That seems to me all the more reason for sparing her,” said the prince timidly.</p>
			<p>“Prince, you are not only simple, but your simplicity is almost past the limit,” said Lebedeff’s nephew, with a sarcastic smile.</p>
			<p>“But what right had you?” said Hippolyte in a very strange tone.</p>
			<p>“None⁠—none whatever,” agreed the prince hastily. “I admit you are right there, but it was involuntary, and I immediately said to myself that my personal feelings had nothing to do with it⁠—that if I thought it right to satisfy the demands of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky, out of respect for the memory of Pavlicheff, I ought to do so in any case, whether I esteemed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky or not. I only mentioned this, gentlemen, because it seemed so unnatural to me for a son to betray his mother’s secret in such a way. In short, that is what convinced me that Tchebaroff must be a rogue, and that he had induced <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky to attempt this fraud.”</p>
			<p>“But this is intolerable!” cried the visitors, some of them starting to their feet.</p>
			<p>“Gentlemen, I supposed from this that poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky must be a simple-minded man, quite defenceless, and an easy tool in the hands of rogues. That is why I thought it my duty to try and help him as ‘Pavlicheff’s son’; in the first place by rescuing him from the influence of Tchebaroff, and secondly by making myself his friend. I have resolved to give him 10,000 roubles; that is about the sum which I calculate that Pavlicheff must have spent on me.”</p>
			<p>“What, only 10,000!” cried Hippolyte.</p>
			<p>“Well, prince, your arithmetic is not up to much, or else you are mighty clever at it, though you affect the air of a simpleton,” said Lebedeff’s nephew.</p>
			<p>“I will not accept 10,000 roubles,” said Burdovsky.</p>
			<p>“Accept, Antip,” whispered the boxer eagerly, leaning past the back of Hippolyte’s chair to give his friend this piece of advice. “Take it for the present; we can see about more later on.”</p>
			<p>“Look here, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Muishkin,” shouted Hippolyte, “please understand that we are not fools, nor idiots, as your guests seem to imagine; these ladies who look upon us with such scorn, and especially this fine gentleman” (pointing to Evgenie Pavlovitch) “whom I have not the honour of knowing, though I think I have heard some talk about him⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Really, really, gentlemen,” cried the prince in great agitation, “you are misunderstanding me again. In the first place, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Keller, you have greatly overestimated my fortune in your article. I am far from being a millionaire. I have barely a tenth of what you suppose. Secondly, my treatment in Switzerland was very far from costing tens of thousands of roubles. Schneider received 600 roubles a year, and he was only paid for the first three years. As to the pretty governesses whom Pavlicheff is supposed to have brought from Paris, they only exist in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Keller’s imagination; it is another calumny. According to my calculations, the sum spent on me was very considerably under 10,000 roubles, but I decided on that sum, and you must admit that in paying a debt I could not offer <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky more, however kindly disposed I might be towards him; delicacy forbids it; I should seem to be offering him charity instead of rightful payment. I don’t know how you cannot see that, gentlemen! Besides, I had no intention of leaving the matter there. I meant to intervene amicably later on and help to improve poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky’s position. It is clear that he has been deceived, or he would never have agreed to anything so vile as the scandalous revelations about his mother in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Keller’s article. But, gentlemen, why are you getting angry again? Are we never to come to an understanding? Well, the event has proved me right! I have just seen with my own eyes the proof that my conjecture was correct!” he added, with increasing eagerness.</p>
			<p>He meant to calm his hearers, and did not perceive that his words had only increased their irritation.</p>
			<p>“What do you mean? What are you convinced of?” they demanded angrily.</p>
			<p>“In the first place, I have had the opportunity of getting a correct idea of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky. I see what he is for myself. He is an innocent man, deceived by everyone! A defenceless victim, who deserves indulgence! Secondly, Gavrila Ardalionovitch, in whose hands I had placed the matter, had his first interview with me barely an hour ago. I had not heard from him for some time, as I was away, and have been ill for three days since my return to <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg. He tells me that he has exposed the designs of Tchebaroff and has proof that justifies my opinion of him. I know, gentlemen, that many people think me an idiot. Counting upon my reputation as a man whose purse-strings are easily loosened, Tchebaroff thought it would be a simple matter to fleece me, especially by trading on my gratitude to Pavlicheff. But the main point is⁠—listen, gentlemen, let me finish!⁠—the main point is that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff’s son at all. Gavrila Ardalionovitch has just told me of his discovery, and assures me that he has positive proofs. Well, what do you think of that? It is scarcely credible, even after all the tricks that have been played upon me. Please note that we have positive proofs! I can hardly believe it myself, I assure you; I do not yet believe it; I am still doubtful, because Gavrila Ardalionovitch has not had time to go into details; but there can be no further doubt that Tchebaroff is a rogue! He has deceived poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky, and all of you, gentlemen, who have come forward so nobly to support your friend⁠—(he evidently needs support, I quite see that!). He has abused your credulity and involved you all in an attempted fraud, for when all is said and done this claim is nothing else!”</p>
			<p>“What! a fraud? What, he is not Pavlicheff’s son? Impossible!”</p>
			<p>These exclamations but feebly expressed the profound bewilderment into which the prince’s words had plunged Burdovsky’s companions.</p>
			<p>“Certainly it is a fraud! Since <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky is not Pavlicheff’s son, his claim is neither more nor less than attempted fraud (supposing, of course, that he had known the truth), but the fact is that he has been deceived. I insist on this point in order to justify him; I repeat that his simple-mindedness makes him worthy of pity, and that he cannot stand alone; otherwise he would have behaved like a scoundrel in this matter. But I feel certain that he does not understand it! I was just the same myself before I went to Switzerland; I stammered incoherently; one tries to express oneself and cannot. I understand that. I am all the better able to pity <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky, because I know from experience what it is to be like that, and so I have a right to speak. Well, though there is no such person as ‘Pavlicheff’s son,’ and it is all nothing but a humbug, yet I will keep to my decision, and I am prepared to give up 10,000 roubles in memory of Pavlicheff. Before <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky made this claim, I proposed to found a school with this money, in memory of my benefactor, but I shall honour his memory quite as well by giving the 10,000 roubles to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky, because, though he was not Pavlicheff’s son, he was treated almost as though he were. That is what gave a rogue the opportunity of deceiving him; he really did think himself Pavlicheff’s son. Listen, gentlemen; this matter must be settled; keep calm; do not get angry; and sit down! Gavrila Ardalionovitch will explain everything to you at once, and I confess that I am very anxious to hear all the details myself. He says that he has even been to Pskoff to see your mother, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burdovsky; she is not dead, as the article which was just read to us makes out. Sit down, gentlemen, sit down!”</p>
			<p>The prince sat down, and at length prevailed upon Burdovsky’s company to do likewise. During the last ten or twenty minutes, exasperated by continual interruptions, he had raised his voice, and spoken with great vehemence. Now, no doubt, he bitterly regretted several words and expressions which had escaped him in his excitement. If he had not been driven beyond the limits of endurance, he would not have ventured to express certain conjectures so openly. He had no sooner sat down than his heart was torn by sharp remorse. Besides insulting Burdovsky with the supposition, made in the presence of witnesses, that he was suffering from the complaint for which he had himself been treated in Switzerland, he reproached himself with the grossest indelicacy in having offered him the 10,000 roubles before everyone. “I ought to have waited till tomorrow and offered him the money when we were alone,” thought Muishkin. “Now it is too late, the mischief is done! Yes, I am an idiot, an absolute idiot!” he said to himself, overcome with shame and regret.</p>
			<p>Till then Gavrila Ardalionovitch had sat apart in silence. When the prince called upon him, he came and stood by his side, and in a calm, clear voice began to render an account of the mission confided to him. All conversation ceased instantly. Everyone, especially the Burdovsky party, listened with the utmost curiosity.</p>
